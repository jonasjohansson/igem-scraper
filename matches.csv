Aachen,Europe,Germany,New Application,Accepted,2016,https://2016.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Description,welcome to igem aachen 2016the aim of this years project is to replace a harmful ingredient from laundry detergents with the help of synthetic biology modern detergent formulations contain a variety of enzymes to target stains specifically and efficiently this helps to significantly reduce the amount of surfactants needed laundry detergents contain proteases whose longtime storage is especially problematic due to selfdegradation later they even degrade other useful enzymes in the final mixture thus they are inhibited by adding an equal mass of boric acid this chemical has been classified as a substance of very high concern by the european chemicals agency as studies indicate its reproductive toxicity and teratogenicity  1 consequently many attempts have been made to replace it  but up to now the approaches were either not efficient enough or had severe disadvantages regarding safety  in 2014 595 000 tons of laundry detergents were  consumed solely within germany  2 boric acid is naturally present in drinking water and the environment in traces but use of washing detergents makes its amount exceed the natural occurrence 3 we want to avoid the usage of boric acid to stop its influx into the water cycle because of the continuously high amount of washing detergents consumed  the method we consider perfect for this challenging task is photocaging of enzymes  it allows activation through light waves which are the fastest and most convenient way to get an activation signal to its destination the method of photocaging is conceptually simple and in theory applicable for every protein conveniently this would also render the handling of tons of chemicals for enzyme stabilization unnecessary so far though the method has only been used in intracellular studies for investigation of enzyme function 46with this project we hope to demonstrate the versatility of photocaging for industrially applicable enzymes by example go laundry detergents proteases our aim is to produce a photocaged protease for washing detergents photocaging allows expressing a protease inhibited by only one covalently bound molecule directly prior to the washing process it could be activated with light by cleaving off this molecule the key of this method is attaching a chemical protection group to a normally reactive molecule which is thereby shielded from reacting and can be cleaved off when irradiated with the respective spectrum of light by replacing an amino acid which is crucial to the function of the enzyme with the corresponding photocaged amino acid a protected enzyme would be generated exposure to the correct spectrum of light would lead to cleavage of the protection group and yield the original amino acid and therefore a functional enzyme the introduction of this noncanonical amino acid can be achieved via genetic code expansion the host organism is provided with an orthogonal trnasynthetase pair that is capable of incorporating the noncanonical amino acid of choice at a uag codon the uag or amber codon is the least used stop codon in most organisms which makes it perfect for being reassigned 4 more and more orthogonal trnasynthetase pairs are being created but researchers are limited to available ones if time does not allow the development of the synthetase that meets ones special needs as this is the case for our project the following strategies have been developed to achieve reversible inactivation subtilisin is a protease from bacillus subtilis whose derivatives are being used in many washing detergents which makes it suitable for a proof of principle like a serine protease it catalyzes the cleavage of a peptide bond by means of a catalytic triad consisting of serine221 aspartic acid32 and histidine64 7previous studies proved that replacing the serine with an alanine which equals the loss of the reactive group reduces the activity by factors of 2106 as the protection group would shield the hydroxyl group the inhibition should be at least equally effectivean orthogonal trnasynthetase pair which is able to introduce the photoliable serine derivative o45dimethoxy2nitrobenzyllserine dmnbserine at an amber stop codon exists in saccharomyces cerevisiae it was developed and successfully used by p g schultz 5 dmnbserine is converted to serine by irradiation with low energy blue lightthe first challenge is the production of subtilisin e in s cerevisiae thus an expression system has to be built we chose to try three different approaches to compare efficiency of production a plasmid with a constitutive promotor one with an inducible and an inducible genome integration vector then by providing the yeast cells with the trnasynthetase pair for dmnbserine the respective noncanonical amino acid can be incorporated mutation of the codon for serine221 to an amber stop codon in the subtilisin gene should lead to production of a photocaged and consequently inactive variant also the naturally occurring secretion tag from b subtilis that allows relocation of the enzyme to the medium shall be exchanged with a secretion tag working in s cerevisiae to make harvesting more convenient as previous efforts to express a protease from b subtilis in s cerevisiae failed due to hyperglycosylation 8 which resulted in an inactive enzyme we also pursued a second strategy thus the idea to develop a dmnbssynthetase that works in escherichia coli evolved escherichia coli is widely used in synthetic biology it offers the advantage of being a comparatively simple and wellunderstood model organism while being easy to handle in the laboratory environment also an expansion of the genetic code has already been successfully implemented in e coli multiple times 912 by introducing an orthogonal trnasynthetase pairtherefore working with e coli is an obvious choicedue to a limited range of trnasynthetase pairs for noncanonical amino acids in general and especially for those that act orthogonally in e coli photocaging serine in the active site of subtilisin e with dmnbserine is currently not possible hence another strategy is needed to produce temporarily inactive proteases this part of the project focuses on utilizing the maturation process of subtilisin esubtilisin e is an alkaline serine protease found in bacillus subtilis that has to autoprocess itself to become functional at first the enzyme exists as a precursor namely the preprosubtilisin the presequence serves as a recognition sequence for secretion across the cytoplasmic membrane and is cleaved off in the course of the process the propeptide acts as an intramolecular chaperone imc and facilitates the folding of the protease folding is essential for the activity of an enzyme still the maturation process of subtilisin e is not completed as the propeptide covers the substrate binding site and inhibits activity however enough proteolytic activity is achieved to autoprocess the imcdomain and therefore cleave off the propeptide yet the cterminal end of the propeptide continues to block the substrate binding site after the degradation of the propeptide the substratebinding site is cleared and the protease becomes effectively active 13this mechanism can be used to implement a novel inactivation method o2nitrobenzylltyrosine onby is a derivative of the canonical amino acid tyrosine it carries a photolabile protection group that can be cleaved off by irradiation with uvlight 365nm 14by adding onby to the genetic code of e coli and incorporating said amino acid in the propeptide cleavagesite of subtilisin e the maturation process is disturbed due to its size onby sterically hinders the protease 15 the propeptide cannot be cleaved from the enzyme and subtilisin e is not able to achieve its full proteolytic activity a temporarily inactive protease is producedafter removal of the protection group the maturation process can be completed and subtilisin e acquires its full proteolytic activityintroductionphotocleavable noncanonical amino acids offer the opportunity to control protein function on a noninvasive basis working with noncanonical amino acids requires an additional orthogonal pair of a trna and a cognate synthetase which does not crossreact with the endogenous trnasynthetase pairs 5 a previously reported trnasynthetase pair for o45dimethoxy2nitrobenzyllserine dmnbs derived from escherichia coli and was used in saccharomyces cerevisiae 5 however this trnasynthetase pair can not be used in e coli due to orthogonalitynevertheless the shape of the binding pocket which is adapted to this specific noncanonical serine can be used as  template to create an orthogonal trnasynthetase pair for the use in e colibased on computational modeling a synthetase for dmnbs in e coli is designed mainly because of three reasonsfor that purpose the well described tyrosyltrnasynthetase pair of methanococcus janaschii is mutated to selectively incorporate dmnbs into proteins in e coli the cognate trnas anticodon contains an amber stop anticodon hence it is possible to incorporate an amino acid at a chosen position in a protein via amber codon suppressiondesign of dmnbstrnasynthetase pairas the basis for designing a dmnbs specific synthetase the wild type tyrosylsynthetase of m janaschii mjtyrrs is chosen due to its well characterized properties its resemblance to the e colileucylsynthetase ecleurs derived dmnbssynthetase used in yeast and its availability through the igemteam austin texas 2014it was also previously shown that this pair is orthogonal to endogenous e coli synthetases 16the determination of the alterations to be made for changing the amino acid specificity are based on the comparison of the crystal structures of mjtyrosyl and ecleutrnasynthetase pairs highly conserved amino acids y32 l65 and d158 are known to build hbonds with the natural ligand tyrosine 17 furthermore these sites resemble the mutated sites within e colileucylsynthetase which was already changed to a dmnbsspecificity and is successfully used in yeast to incorporate dmnbs 1618 some more positions are chosen to be mutated due to their location within the 2radius of bound dmnbs for creating a mutant library sites to mutate were determined and partially randomized codons for site saturated mutagenesis also with respect to the codon usage of e coli were chosencharacterization of synthetase plasmidsa low copy number plasmid p15a 1012 copies per cell is used to express the dmnbssynthetase variants and methanococcus janaschiiwild type tyrosyltrna in order to test incorporation values of dmnbs via amber codon suppression expression is used to be constitutive a gentamicin resistance reporter gene is used for selectioncharacterization of prxg partbba_k1416004 called pfryonce the screening method for measuring the fidelity and incorporation efficiency of the created trnasynthetase pairs a fluorescencebased method as established by the the igemteam austin texas 2014 is used a twoplasmid system  one plasmid prxg contains an iptginducible rfpsfgfp reporter protein construct and the additional plasmid the trnasynthetase pair the prxg plasmid consists of a rfp domain which is connected by a linker sequence containing an amber stop codon with a sfgfp domain the expression of the plasmid results either in red fluorescence or  if the ncaa is incorporated at the amber stop codon within the linker site  in both red and green fluorescenceby comparison of fluorescence levels it is possible to determine incorporation efficiency of the generated synthetase variantsa kanamycin resistance reporter gene is used for selection of the reporter plasmid furthermore the expression of the fluorescence proteins is kept under lacoperon control for iptg inductionthe reporter plasmid as described above has been created by igem team austin texas 2014 a biobrick has been built from it and characterized for further useby igemteam austin texas 2014screeningfor both positive and negative screening m9 minimal medium is used because it has a lower optical density itself and contains buffer to stabilize the fluorescence proteinsas a pretest the excitation and emission wavelengths of the fluorescence proteins are measured along with the od600 thus the wavelengths for the screening process are identifiedto transform the mutation library into e coli the following strategy is applied the reporter plasmid is transformed into ecoli bl21 de3 gold from which subsequently chemical competent cells are made the library then is transformed into those cells and onto m9 minimal solid medium with gentamycin and kanamycin for selectiona preculture is inoculated each well with one colony in 96well microtiter plates in m9 minimal medium  microtiter plates are sealed with microporous tape sheets because fluorescence proteins mature under the influence of oxygen as an intermediate step the precultures are replicated onto a next microtiter plate for the purpose of homogenizing the cell density thereof two separate screening microtiter plates are inoculated firstly a positive screening plate with m9 minimal medium addition of 2mm dmnbs as well as 100m iptg for expression secondly a negative screening plate without dmnbs all microtiter plates are measured after the same amount of time incubation was performed at 900rpm 30c and ph 76 od600 and both red and green fluorescence levels are measured as an endpoint measurement thus the most efficient clones can be determined to selectively incorporate dmnbs at an amber stop codon to obtain final results the newfound working dmnbs trnasynthetase pair clones undergo an online measurement rescreening with each nine replicates and the previously mentioned growth and screening conditions results can be found here to get an overview of the growth of s cerevisiae cenpk21d cells we compared the growth of the yeast cells carrying the empty vector in the induced and the noninduced conditionswe used the growth profiler gp960 enzyscreen heemstede the netherlands which is a temperature controlled shaker for microtiterplates with a scanner for growth detection  the logarithmic growth phase was determined to be from 4 to 7 hours after induction comparing the induced and noninduced cultures it can be seen that they grow much better with additional galactose since s cerevisiae can metabolize it as a carbon sourcein order to improve the significance of these measurements addition of glucose to the noninduced cells can be an outlook for further work furthermore the cells carrying the mfalphamcherry inserts partbba_k2020026 and partbba_e2060 are not affected in their growth after induction as the blue and yellow curves show how the reporter plasmid worksthis reporter plasmid is one of the two plasmids containing screening system for determining efficiency and fidelity of noncanonical amino acids ncaa incorporation via amber termination suppression one plasmid contains trna and its corresponding aminoacylationsynthetase the other one is this plasmid presented herein it consists of a mrfp1 domain which is connected through a linker sequence containing a recoded amber stop codon with a sfgfp domain the expression of the plasmid gives either a red fluorescence or  if the ncaa is incorporated at the recoded amber stop codon within the linker site  both a red and a green fluorescencesynthetase and trna are constitutively expressed in a plasmid with low copy replicon p15a under metabolic stress but are not under iptg control for the purpose of avoiding abrupt and unpredictable effects considering the time and energy required for their assembly whereas the reporter plasmid containing two fluorescence proteins is kept under operon control for iptg induction like a low copy plasmid with cole1cultivation conditions with high throughput measurementin order to evolve a new aminoacylation synthetase for dmnbs in ecoli and transforming a mutant library into competent cells by using the following order of events to get a maximum output and equal optical densitiesit was shown previously that sufficient gfp expression was achieved by supplementing iptg and ncaa but causes a decelerated growth 1 in fact cultivation of bl21 de3 gold containing two different plasmids show reduced growth rates when adding 100m iptg and 2 mm dmnbs to m9 minimal medium results in a growth phase of 4248 h at 30c to reach maximum cell densityhost organismthis reporter plasmid and the measurement of its corresponding proteins expressed are previously used both in an amberless ecoli strain and bl21 de3 gold the latter results in competition of the suppressor trna with rf1 at the amber stop codonmeasurement wavelengthas a prescreening setup an endpoint detection of od and fluorescence intensities with microtiterplate reader is chosen excitation and emission spectra of mrfp1 and sfgfp were obtained from a previously conducted measurement fig 8 for screening with tecan plate reader the following settings were usedwhile rescreening for the detection of endpoint the same plate reader setup was used additionally an online measurement monitoring sfgfp and mrfp1 formation as well as scattered light measurement at 650 nm is used this is achieved by a screening platform based on the established biolector setup 19measurement evaluationif the levels of optical density of the synthetase to be evaluated and a working synthetase are equal a first approximation of efficiency and fidelity can be made by normalizing gfp levels thus one can eliminate the biogenic background fluorescence levels and compare the clones with each other this mutant corresponds to no 1 with the reporter plasmid evaluated synthetasesdmnbs mutantslinksattributionsigem team austin texas thanks for making the measurement kit available to usone of the things which we need to consider when we choose to work with lightsensitive materials is an apt environment light sensitive materials on exposure to stray light experience changes in properties on exposure to stray light what makes them problematic to work with under normal conditions it requires a dedicated room where the lighting is controlled usually by using filtered red or amber safelight but due to economic time and spatial limitations not every school university and institute can have this dark room hence we have developed an affordable convenient and portable workspace to handle these lightsensitive materials called darkbench it can be assembled and disassembled at any place with little effortafter resolving a safe place to work with we required a device with which we can study the photo cleavage reaction by activating the caged amino acid by irradiating at a specific wavelength since the realworld application of our project is to activate the caged subtilisin in the liquid detergent the uncaging device the so called lips stick should be cheap and easytouse that is made possible by incorporating pumps and a control circuit for optimal light exposure by adjusting various parameters automatically with further miniaturization it can also be integrated into washing machines in the futureboth of the devices were developed not only to satisfy our project needs but also were made with affordable and readily available components so as to make it accessible to all more information about the hardware aspect of our project can be found

Aachen,Europe,Germany,Environment,Accepted,2017,https://2017.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Description,igem team aachen 2017        salt water is causing problems all over the world leading to a loss of diversity in ecosystems and freshwater scarcity a main reason for this pollution is industrial wastewaterwe tackled this problem by using salt accumulating microorganisms engineered through synthetic biologyour project is based on saccharomyces cerevisiae read more about why we chose this organism in our design section we engineered different ion transporters to increase the nacl uptake into the prevacuolar compartments and the vacuole of scerevisiaewe started by knocking out the native systems responsible for the extrusion of sodium to the extracellular roomadditionally we overexpressed the native sodium hydrogen antiporter nhx1 that together with the chloride channel gef1 is responsible for the sequestration of nacl in the prevacuolar compartmentsas part of their salt tolerance mechanism plants like arabidopsis thaliana are able to sequestrate ions in their vacuole we used this system to increase the salt accumulation in scerevisiaewe integrated an optimised variant of the arabidopsis sodium hydrogen antiporter into the vacuolar membrane of scerevisiae enabling salt sequestration in that compartmentatnhxs1 uses h protons to transport sodium against its concentration gradient by integrating the arabidopsis pyrophosphatase avp1 into the vacuolar membrane of yeast we acidify the vacuole and thus increase the efficiency of transporters using such a proton gradientfollowing our integrated human practices we expanded our project from nacl to also accumulate other salts for this reason we integrated arabidopsis channels for the import of sulphate atsultr12 and potassium atakt1to get an idea of the efficiency of our designed system we modelled the kinetics and interactions between the tranporters we proved that scerevisiae does survive high salt concentrations and furthermore does not burst when the intracellular salt concentration is significantly higher than the extracellular onewe proved that our designed yeast accumulates more salt from the environment than the wildtype organism in cooperation with general electric we developed a membrane system to guarantee that no organisms are released to the environment in our applicationa sustainable application of our salt vault that we evolved together with representatives from industry research and public is one of the results of the integration of our human practiceswhile developing our mutante and our application we took care of minimizing negative environmental impacts therefore we created an organism carrying no antibiotic resistances and developed systems to prevent environmental exposure on the african continent and in the middle east the supply of fresh water is a major problem but also in germany there is a contamination of rivers and groundwater by municipalities agriculture and most of all industry the sewage is contaminated with various pollutants but in particular industrial wastewater often contains large amounts of different saltsthe werra a german river is considered one of the dirtiest in central europe the reason for this is an extremely high salt load the value for chloride is about 5000 higher than that of a comparable flow without an extreme introduction of sewage the amounts of magnesium and potassium are also far above the normal valuethe reason for the load is the introduction of lye from the mining industryat the werra potash salts are extracted which are exported for fertilizer production worldwide a waste product of this potash salt recovery is sodium chloride however magnesium salts and others as well these waste products are either disposed of on huge hills pressed into the ground or led into the werra as the already mentioned lyefig2 the ion concentration in the werra green compared to a similar river without salt introduction from potash industry red this leads to a chloride concentration in the werra that is over 2000 mg  l high this increased chloride content together with other increased ion concentrations leads to catastrophic damage to the ecosystem before the destruction through the introduction of industrial waste water without prior purification the macrozoobenthos of the werra was composed of 60100 species  nowadays the environment is dominated by only one species the boosted river cancer a brackish water species from north america is a neozoe unnaturally introduced species and became the dominant living being in addition the new zealand dwarf snail also a neozoe occurs frequently there is only a small amount of mosquitos fly larvae and some other species from the originally occurring species in the body of water with an extremely small share of the individual species of the ecosystem to tackle the significant damage salt stress causes in rivers like the werra but also to find a solution for ion burden in industrial process wasters we developed salt vaultthe aim of our salt vault system is to absorb as many sodium and chloride ions as possible to reduce the salt content in water the system developed by us is based on the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae which is not only a model organism but also has a vacuole which is of central importance for our project details of why we chose this organism see the  design sections cerevisiae has a large number of ion transporters and channels involved in the transport of sodium potassium and chloride ions these proteins are controlled by various regulatory mechanisms and work together to maintain the ion homeostasis in the cytosol of the yeast when the external salt concentrations vary which is of central importance for metabolism there are multiple transport systems in the plasma membrane that lead to an influx of sodium but there are no specific sodium importers in the plasma membrane 8 the influx is only significant when sodium has much higher extracellular concentration than potassium 98 which in our application is the case phosphate influx into the cytoplasm is coupled to sodium and carried out by the cotransporter pho89 contributing to sodium import 810low affinity nonspecific cation importers in the plasma membrane do not discriminate between k and na leading to an import of both 11trk1 actually a potassium importer transports na in addition to k although with lower affinity 12sodium ions play an important role for the function of macromolecules 8 on the other hand an increased intracellular concentration can lead to toxic effects because sodium ions can disturb the correct function of specific cellular pathways 9 the most important transporters forming this system are shown in figure 4fig4 ena1 and nha1 form the native efflux system responsible for the extrusion of sodium from the cytosol nhx1 and gef1 lead to sequestration of sodium and chloride in the prevacuolar compartments confering salt tolerance while also reducing toxic effects of sodium in the cytosolwhen there is an increased concentration of sodium chloride in the environment s cerevisiae reacts essentially in two ways to the entrance of sodium and chloride into the cytosol1 an efflux system consisting of two proteins encoded by the ena1 and nha1 genes transports sodium back into the extracellular space 1518because the natural abundance of sodium ions in the environment is higher than the relatively low intracellular concentration most eukaryotic organisms developed mechanisms to remove sodium ions from the cytosol especially at high external sodium concentrations saccharomyces cerevisiae relies on the ability to extrude the cation from the cytosol to maintain a low intracellular concentration to achieve this yeast developed two extrusion mechanisms the hna antiporter encoded by the nha1 gene can extrude na li and k using the proton gradient across the plasma membrane however the primary pathway for the extrusion of sodium ions is the plasma membrane ptype na atpase encoded by ena1 for exnus natru 1718 the ena1 atpase couples the hydrolysis of atp to the transport of cations against the electrochemical gradients out of the cell 19 this is because in yeast the ena1 gene plays an important role in salt tolerance it encodes the most important protein for the extrusion of na and li out of the cell under saline stress conditions 2018 in response to saline or alkaline ph stress the expression of ena1 increases significantly amongst other things through the activation of calcineurin 212317  fig5 the two proteins responsible for the efflux of sodium as a stress response are highlighted in pink ena1 is a primary active sodium atpase while nha1 is a secondary active antiporter relying on the proton gradient over the plasma membranebecause the ena1 mutant lacks most of the sodium efflux ability the intracellular sodium content is increased when compared to that in the wildtype 24 this organism then heavely relies on the internal detoxification system to survive salt stress2 nhx1 transports sodium into prevacuolar compartments 2526 the gef1 channel causes the followup of chloride ions this system is described with the sequestration model characterizing the sequestration of sodium in the prevacuolar compartments and thereby lowering the toxic cytosolic concentration in the ena1 mutant 2527 nhx1 is a nah exchanger and mediates the sequestration of sodium into the prevacuolar compartments but is not contributing to the efflux of na to the extracellular room 26 it has been shown that nhx1 is localized exclusively in unique endosomalprevacuolar compartments 25 through enhancing the sequestration of sodium in the endosomal membrane system it was possible to restore the salt tolerance of the ena1 mutant 24 this is due to the reduced salt  concentration in the cytosol but increased concentration in the prevacuolar compartments responsible for that is nhx1 that uses the proton gradient over the membrane of this acidic compartments generated by the vacuolar atpase to sequestrate sodium 26 fig5 b 2d topology of the gef1 chloride channelthus and due to other mechanisms the organism is able to maintain a healthy ratio of sodium and potassium in the cytosol even if the environmental conditions strongly fluctuate if a hyperosmotic shock occurs scerevisiae can reduce its intracellular water potential by importing these ions into the compartments via nhx1 and gef1 and consequentially survive making the organism capable of a certain natural salt tolerance 26in order to achieve our goal of accumulating as much sodium chloride as possible in the cell we have modified some of these channels to prevent the salt from leaving the cell at the same time it is to be ensured that as much salt as possible is stored in the prevacuolar compartmentsthe changes we made in the yeast native channel system are shown in figure 6 they can be subdivided into two areas the destruction of the two most important efflux mechanisms ena1 and nha1 so that as little salt as possible leaves the cell overexpression of nhx1 to maximize the sodium and therefore chloride uptake into the prevacuolar compartmentsfig6 we knocked out the two efflux mechanisms ena1 and nha1 and overexpressed nhx1 to increase the sequestration of ions in the intracellular compartmentsthese mutations were performed individually as well as in various combinations to identify the most efficient mutant  results to learn more about the methodology we used for these changes check out our workflow and protocols pages but while working on and modifying the native transport system of s cerevisiae we have also integrated a new system which offers further possibilities of increasing the salt intake  for this purpose we used a combination of ion transporters that are found in the plant arabidopsis thaliana the system differs from that in s cerevisiae since plants react comparable but not similar to salt stressatnhx1plant vacuolar membrane nah antiporter genes play an important role in cellular ion homeostasis especially the sequestration of na in the vacuole to confer salt stress resistance in plants 2830 vacuolar membranebound and h translocating enzyme h adenosine triphosphatase atpase and h inorganic pyrophosphatase ppiase generate an electrochemical potential across the membrane through a proton gradient 3132 that is used by the nah antiporters to move na against its electrochemical potential and accumulate it inside the vacuole 31 in arabidopsis thaliana the most abundant  nah antiporter atnhx1 is bound to the vacuolar membrane 33  it mediates the import of not only na but also k into the vacuole and with that contributes to the accumulation of cations significantly 2829 atnhx1 is a channel which is homologous to the yeast nhx1 gene that encodes a nah antiporter in the prevacuolar compartment 34 when atnhx1 is knocked out in arabidopsis thaliana the plant loses its ability to sequestrate sodium and thus is more sensitive to salt stress 35fig7the arabidopsis thaliana proton sodium antiporter is integrated into the vacuolar membrane of scerevisiae in addition to the alteration in the native system of the organismoverexpression of atnhx1 led to an increased vacuolar nah transport rate that was higher than the relative increase in atnhx1 protein abundance and increased accumulation of sodium in the vacuole of arabidopsis thaliana through that the salt tolerance was increased confirming atnhx1 plays an important role in salt stress response 282936 we decided to use this channel and integrate it into the vacuolar membrane of scerevisiae but while overexpression of atnhx1 increased its nah transport rate the still relatively low vmax of this transporter is limiting the application in terms of fast hyperaccumulation of sodium in the vacuole 30through dna shuffling it was possible to generate a mutated channel  called atnhxs1  that showed an about twofold increased nah vmax while the kh exchange activity was not significantly altered when compared to the native form of atnhx1 the channel is still localized in the vacuolar membrane but the plant cell accumulated more sodium than the native strain with atnhx1 30 atnhxs1 consists only of 4 transmembrane helices the cterminus and the 5 nearest transmembrane helices of atnhx1 where deleted resulting in the increase in nak  selectivity ratio described previously 30atnhxs1 also shows two mutations l29p and s158p in its amino acid sequence that might be responsible for the increased sodium transport activity and thus enable increased sodium sequestration in the vacuole figure 8 30 we integrated this synthetic transporter into the vacuolar membrane to use the yeasts vacuole as an additional compartment for salt storage with higher volume than the prevacuolar compartments figure 7  fig8 comparison of atnhxs1 and atnhx1 atnhxs1 was generated through dna shuffeling and lost 5 transmembrane helices and the regulatory cterminus this mutant of atnhx1 is more efficient and is not negatively regulated resulting in higher sequestrationavp1to increase the efficiency of this channel we will additionally integrate the protein encoded by avp1 into the vacuolar membrane of scerevisiae cation antiporters like atnhx1 or nhx1 mediate the transport of solutes from the cytosol into the vacuolar lumen against their concentration gradient using the proton gradient over the vacuolar membrane or prevacuolar compartment membrane in case of nhx1 37  in yeast this proton gradient is generated by the membrane bound hatpase that uses atp to translocate protons into the vacuole and thus acidifies this compartment 38 in principle by increasing the availability of protons through an enhanced expression of thevacuolar hatpase the sequestration of ions in the vacuole should increase 39 but the overexpression of vacuolar hatpase would be difficult because the yeast vacuolar hatpase is a multisubunit protein 40 each of the subunits would have to be overexpressed exactly at the right level at the same time to get an increased activity of the complex protein 41fig9 avp1 uses pyrophosphate to pump protons into the vacuole thus causing acidification of this compartment the proton gradient can be used by secondary active transporters like atnhxs1 to pump ions into the vacuole against their concentration gradient in contrast to yeast the proton electrochemical gradient across the vacuolar membrane tonoplast of arabidopsis thaliana is generated by two proteins the plant vacuolar hatpase and avp1 the vacuolar membrane bound hpyrophosphatase which is encoded by only a single gene 42 avp1 as a vacuolar hpyrophosphatase hydrolyses cytosolic inorganic pyrophosphate ppi to orthophosphate pi to use the derived energy to actively pump protons into the vacuole figure 9 4345 this process not only reduces the cytosolic ppi concentration but more importantly acidifies the vacuole 4647 the difference in electrochemical potential for protons across the tonoplast generated by the vacuolar hatpase and avp1 can then beused by vacuolar transporters eg atnhx1 to pump ions into the vacuole 464849 resulting from that there will also be a compensatory transport of anions to maintain electroneutrality 50 through expression of the arabidopsis thaliana hppi ase avp1 in yeast it is possible to increase the translocation of protons and anions over the tonoplast and thus acidify the vacuole 44 this increased protoninflux leads to more cytosolic na being sequestered inside the vacuole via the nhx1 exchangers and in general leads to a higher solute accumulation through hsyn and antiporters 403943 this shows that the vacuole acidification through avp1 plays a key role in facilitating vacuolar na sequestration 51 and increases the concentration of cations in the vacuole 39fig10 avp1 together with atnhxs1 leads to an increased sequestration of sodium in the vacuole this system is added to the altered native one we have integrated the gene avp1 together with atnhxs1 into the yeasts vacuolar membrane figure 10 together with the changes we carried out in the native transporter system of s cerevisiae this can be described as an expanded and optimized sequestration model to maximize the salt concentration in the yeast and remove it from the wastewater you can compare the salt uptake of different combinations of transporters we integrated into scerevisiae in our  results page we also compared the salt tolerance of the different mutants because this is a good indicator for the functionality of our laboratory work and model before we integrated the different combinations of channels we created a mathematical model of our system to determine the maximal amount of salt our system can take upfollowing our intensive integrated human practice work we realized that contamination of wastewater through salts is not restricted to na and cl but that ions like k and so4 lead to problems too read more about the negative effects of these ions in our integrated hp section potassium contamination is discussed in the section about the werra while details about problems with sulphate can be found in the interviews at the municipal and chemical wastewater treatment plants following the input we got from these cooperations we decided to identify possible channels for alteration to increase the accumulation of potassium and sulphate atakt1we identified atakt1 as a promising gene to increase the potassium accumulation atakt1 is a potassium channel originally from arabidopsis thaliana root tissue it mediates potassium uptake over a wide range of potassium concentration in the extracellular room 5255 while there are multiple other families of transporters involved in potassium uptake atakt1 specifically is a high affinity transporter in the plasma membrane 5658 since sodium has a negative effect on the efficiency of atakt1 59 we did not combine a sodium accumulating mutant with this channel but rather created a separate mutant called nakt therefore we integrated the channel in the plasma membrane of a mutant with ena1 and nha already knocked out we did this because the genes not only mediate efflux of sodium but also transport potassium back into the extracellular room compared to the system we created to accumulate sodium inside a cell the atakt1 system does not struggle with the toxicity of the accumulated ions since potassium is a nutrient and indispensable for many physiologic functions and does not inhibit metabolism 8 we were able to accumulate potassium in this mutant details can be found on our  results pagefig11 2d topological structure left and function right of atakt1 atakt1 uses atp to actively import potassium into the cytosol cycln and anky are intracellular regulation domains atsultr12since we want to increase the uptake of sulfate into the vacuoles of saccharomyces cerevisiae we decided to integrate the atsultr12gen the gene encodes for a highaffinity sulfate transporter that naturally occurs in arabidopsis thaliana and is expressed at epidermis and cortex of its roots 60 atsultr12 belongs to a family of sulfate transporters and due to studies with mutants the atsultr12 seems to be the most important one the mutant having a atsultr11knockout showed up a phenotype similar to the wildtype while the atsultr12mutant showed differences in the phenotype compared to the wildtype relating to root length growth and sulphate uptake this confirms the assumption that atsultr12 plays a major role in the sulfate uptake system 61 62  references1r w sleigh h aral l simons et al sustainable management of

Aachen,Europe,Germany,Diagnostics,Accepted,2018,https://2018.igem.org/Team:Aachen/Description,melatonin is a hormone that is of paramount importance for humans and most mammals it has been recognized as the key regulator of the daynight cycle circadianrhythm but equally important it exhibits antioxidant antiaging oncostatic and immunomodulatory properties which emphasises its great versatility in mammals melatonin is mainly secreted by the pineal gland but all organisms produce melatonin in mammals melatonin has antiinflammatory properties by reducing reactive oxygen species ros thereby protecting mitochondria 1 dysfunctions of productive and regulatory melatonin pathways in mammalia could also lead to severe psychological disorders depression and schizophrenia neurodegenerative diseases alzheimers and parkinsons disease as well as fibromyalgia to stay healthy it is necessary to keep the melatonin level in the body under control therefore the prevention and detection are importantwe the igem team aachen 2018 aim to create an efficient and specific melatonin detection system which will be based on yeast cells this way we establish a new system to improve current melatonin detection devices and methods currently melatonin is usually measured with the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa which uses antibodies this method is expensive and laborintensive making melatonin measurement a costly diagnostic method our mission is to provide a faster cheaper and noninvasive methodwhen melatonin binds to the gprotein coupled receptor mt1 arrestins are recruited and bind to the receptor we plan to use this recruitment for an enzymefragment complementation assay on one hand the mt1 receptor will be fused to a fragment of a reporter enzyme  galactosidase from e coli whereas the complementing enzyme fragment will be fused to the arrestin the reporter enzyme is only active and functional if three conditions can be assured melatonin is present outside the cell melatonin binds to the receptor surface mt1 and arrestin binds to the cytoplasmic site of the melatonin receptor if it is the case it is possible to indirectly measure the concentration of the desired molecules in this case melatonin because the two different fragments on mt1 and arrestin assemble and form an active enzyme the substrate xgal interacts with the active enzyme and is transformed to a molecule 55dibromo44dichloroindigo with a different colour such changes are detectable signs of melatonin presence2the membrane permeability for melatonin is high and there is theoretically no need for an exogenous receptor to enable the mediation between extracellular melatonin and the yeast cells itself thus the nuclear receptor rzr can be used for melatonin detection rzr is a human transcription factor that has been shown to upregulate the transcription of certain genes which help cells dealing with oxidative stress as the rzr gene does not exist in s cerevisiae hence we are creating a chimeric receptor with a new recognition sequence for human estrogen response element ere and transform it into the yeast cell there are no published studies about the introduction of rzr in yeast and therefore about its functionality and efficiency in yeast cells also it is not known yet if s cerevisiae has polymerases that are able to interact with the activated rzr receptor and start the transcription of the desired reporter genes in contrast ere is a recognition sequence which is widely used in s cerevisiae sanseverino et al 2005 based on the lack of information it was decided to substitute the original rzr recognition sequence for the transcription with the recognition sequence of the human estrogen receptor heralpha fused to a luciferase gene activation would lead to the expression of luciferase whose luminescence then can be quantitatively measured3melatonin detection in saliva will be based on modified yeast cells in order to make yeast cells capable of detecting different melatonin concentrations in saliva it is necessary to incorporate foreign genes from human cells that recreate the melatonin signalling cascade and additionally inactivate the yeast genes that are involved in its own melatonin production maury et al 2016 since the use of microorganisms for the melatonin measurement restricts this diagnostic method to be executed in a laboratory the development of a cellfree device enables an universal nonlaboratory usage by implementing a melatoninsensitive receptor in a modified yeast cell we are already able to measure melatonin levels because living cells are associated with intensive care our ultimate goal is a cellfree solution that is easy to use this novel cellfree approach will use a highly sensitive method called lspr binding of a melatoninsensitive protein to a dna sequence immobilized on a nanoparticle surface affects the refractive index smallest differences in refractive index can be detected by a change in optical absorption since the change in absorption occurs in the visible wavelength range we can use a conventional smartphone camera as a sensor4contact us                 impressum
